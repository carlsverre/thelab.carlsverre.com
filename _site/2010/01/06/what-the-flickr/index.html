  <p>I have once again delved into the world of imagery, and conjured up a interesting project combining <a href='http://code.google.com/appengine/' title='Google App Engine'>Google App Engine</a>, <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/' title='Django'>Django</a>, <a href='http://www.python.org/' title='Python'>Python</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/p/flickrpy/'>FlickrPy</a> and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/' title='Flickr'>Flickr</a>. The project&#8217;s idea is that with Flickr&#8217;s huge resource of images one should be able to create a game similar to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary' title='pictionary'>pictionary</a>, with the player guessing and Flickr &#8220;drawing&#8221;. My attempt at making this game is called <strong>What the Flickr?!</strong></p>

<h3 id='that_sounds_easy'>That sounds easy!</h3>

<p>Well your wrong. Unfortunately, playing <strong>What the Flickr?!</strong> is difficult due to the Flickr search engine being based on crowd-sourcing. Since all of their terms are user-generated, some search terms come up with completely unrelated results. Thus my first order of business was to figure out a way of getting around this problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t found it yet. So I thought about other methods of making the game easier, and the one I came up with was to make a extremely targeted word list. I wanted words which were commonly used. After scouring the interwebs I found <a href='http://www2.educ.fukushima-u.ac.jp/~ryota/word-list.html' title='Ryota&apos;s word list' target='_blank'>this site</a>. I grabbed all the words except for the &#8220;operations&#8221; column and plugged it into the Google datastore.</p>

<h3 id='so_what_happened_next'>So what happened next?</h3>

<p>A bunch of coding, then no coding for awhile followed by a bunch more coding. Essentially I completed the whole site in about 3 hours broken up into three sessions. Not bad for someone who has only done the Django tutorial.</p>

<p>The reason why I am failing at doing a nice code breakdown is for a couple reasons. First, I am keeping the code internal for now because I have some different plans for it as well as it being pretty unfinished. Second, I am completely exhausted and sick. If you have a problem, bite me.</p>

<h3 id='so_can_i_play'>So, can I play?</h3>

<p>Of course! That is the reason I made this post (and to fulfill my 1 project a month goal). <a href='http://whattheflickr.appspot.com' title='What the Flickr?!'>You can play the game here</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun, and hopefully next month I will have something a bit more interesting!</p>
